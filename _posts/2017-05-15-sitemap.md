This week, and also a bit in the previous time, I have been experimenting with how to get proper SEO on 
the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) website. The first important part was making sure that the detail pages
actually get rendered by Google. This is done by making sure the proper polyfills are in place (I used
[polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) for that, as well as making sure that the meta tags are updated properly.

This, together with some other [changes](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr%20author%3AHaroenv%20is%3Aclosed%20created%3A%3E2017-04-17)
on the Yarn site had a very positive impact on the traffic, which is now hovering around 100k dailysearches
as well as a big jump in page views, and google search result clicks.

The sitemap generator is available as a [project](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-sitemap) on GitHub, 
with already contributions from [Mika](https://github.com/mikaa123) and [Vincent](https://github.com/vvo),
who are great colleagues.

I also experimented with [jsdoc](https://github.com/Haroenv/jsdoc-aas) and how to maybe make it available as
a service for Yarn, but there are a lot of inconsistencies between projects, so that is not going to be
possible soon.
