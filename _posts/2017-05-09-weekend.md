title: Long weekend
---
This weekend was interesting, because I spent it in Bordeaux. After leaving at around 15h Friday, I and two colleagues (Marion and Matthieu) went on our way with a TGV to the south. We were there for [Hack Bordeaux](http://hackbordeaux.com), the first [MLH](https://mlh.io) hackathon in France.

Algolia was one of the main sponsors of this hackathon, which meant that we had multiple functions. A first one is representing Algolia at a booth, pitching what we do and why it's useful. To continue with that point, me and Matthieu gave a live coding session (source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/algolia/hack-bdx)) where we have a tuturial on how to upload data to Algolia with the ruby on rails integration, as well as manually make a generic SQL migration in node. Then we also had a [instantsearch.js](http://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js) frontend that was the same in both implementations. You can see the result of that session at [wine-search.now.sh](https://wine-search.now.sh).

Another role was general helping everyone who has any question that I could help with. This was mostly some nitty-gritty [CORS](https://www.google.be/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=cors&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=_1F7WNi_B_HG8AfY24HQDw) issues (pfff, CORS issues are so annoying to fix), and helping out with people who use Algolia for the first time. 

I stayed the whole night, but slept from from 3am to 6am, because I didn't have that much questions anymore (and I was pretty tired). Overall I had a great experience, and hope to help in lots of hackathons to come, because lots of people found out about our service while I just had fun explaining things.

Earlier a week I did a feature for the Algolia SaaS, the backend that does the actual search for all users. That repository is private, but the fix I did was update a ruby script (my first time actually touching ruby) that made a header file (C++), which contains the descriptions of the unicode characters which are emoji. That way if you type the character `üçï`, which has the description `SLICE OF PIZZA`, you'll get the results in Algolia for `SLICE PIZZA` as an optional query. The `\sOF\s` is being trimmed of, because it contained irrelevant results otherwise. The updates I did to that file was regenerate with Unicode 9 descriptions, which means to update the range of characters to also include a new block of emoji. Because of that change, a block which is between two blocks of emoji, alchemical symbols, will also be translated. The other thing I did was the removal of `OF` in the script itself, and not done manually.

I had a great time contributing to that codebase, and hope to find some things I can improve from time to time there.
