Hey,

This here is the new blog I'll use to explain my experiences doing my internship at Algolia. Right now I'm still in Belgium, at the [git merge](https://git-merge.com) conference with a few of my year-mates. I'm leaving by train next Sunday, and am really looking forward to meeting new people and working together with Lucas, who I know very well from [bullgit](https://bullg.it).

Have fun reading this blog (or don't, I won't mind).
