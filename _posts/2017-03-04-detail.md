First a little update on the search behaviour on Yarn. We see that the operations seem to swing a little more than they did before the update, but that's probably because the number is so much bigger now. 

We see that the average lays a bit below 40 000 searches a day, that's mostly because the feature is way more discoverable now, and has a lot of visibility. I do think that because the detail page isn't finished yet, it'll be hard to keep this amount of usage.

This week I worked mostly on the detail page (no PR open for that yet), in which I used most of the metadata currently in the Algolia index. I'm still unsure which method will be used to fetch the README and the CHANGELOG, a lot of change that I'll add that to the Algolia index as non-searchable, but retrievable attribute, which then can be parsed clientside. 

Some extra data will have to be retrieved from GitHub at runtime, because they have a limit of 60 requests per minute, we can't ask for extra metadata (activity, stars ...) at indexing time, it would delay the indexing by too much. I hope to find a way that uses the current logged in user to do those requests, since a logged in user can do basically as much requests as needed. 

Something else small I worked on is the integration of localisation into the docsearch instance of Yarn ([#395](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pull/395), [#397](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pull/397), [#130](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/130), [#132](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/132) ). What needed to happen is the following: 

1. add logic to the docsearch crawler to fetch a language, default en ([#130](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/130))
2. add configuration to Yarn to be able to fetch only the current language ([#395](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pull/395) and [#397](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pull/397))
3. enable the other languages in docsearch ([#132](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/132))

One of the funniest bugs I managed to fix this week was [#2026](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/issues/2026), in which someone asked to fix their bug with icons. It didn't seem very obvious since the searchbox of instantsearch.js (in contrast to react-instantsearch) doesn't have icons. At first I didn't understand what the bug actually was, so I asked to make a jsfiddle. Then I looked at their website and recognised the search box of the bug report (a site completely in Chinese by the way). I inspected their configuration and saw this

{% include
	image.html
	img='bug.png'
	alt='inspect element open on a font-awesome search icon'
	caption='Safari debugger open on their search button'
%}

This is pretty recognisable as font awesome, which they didn't include in their page. In the end the bug didn't have to do with Algolia, but I love how with just a few moments of digging through what the *actual* problem is, you can solve real things for people.

This week I also filled in two slots during support, which mostly means dispatching into the correct mailbox and answering questions you can.
